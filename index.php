                  <small>This automated message would trigger a machine learning algorithm which incorporates Natural language processing, which would give the farmer a productive list of what needs to be done in the short run and long run to increase productivity,it deploys other core areas such as sales management scheme, phenotyping and plant analysis(image detection) This scales and increases the productivity of the Farm.</small>
